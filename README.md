# Portfolio Web

This is my personal portfolio web project built using React and Tailwind CSS, with React Router DOM for routing.

## Description

This project serves as my online portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. React Router DOM is used for client-side routing, allowing for multiple pages and a seamless user experience.
